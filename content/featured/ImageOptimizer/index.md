The [Image Format optimizer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/image-format-optimizer) is a versatile Node.js module that manipulates query parameters of image URLs sourced from platforms like Contentful and Cloudinary to provide optimized formats like WebP and AVIF. By dynamically adjusting these parameters, the transformer generates new URLs tailored to the user's browser capabilities. This optimization significantly improves page speed, ensuring faster loading times for web pages. The transformer seamlessly integrates into diverse web development projects.
