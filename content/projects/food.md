Introducing my mock food delivery app, built to sharpen React skills by leveraging APIs from different food delivery platforms. While not functional for actual orders, it offers users an immersive experience akin to real food delivery apps. From browsing menus to simulating order placement, it provides a hands-on way to explore React development.
