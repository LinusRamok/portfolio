I contributed in the development of a Financial Portfolio Management System for client [National Grid](https://www.nationalgrid.com/). This application efficiently handles critical financial operations, such as capital expenditures (CAPEX), operational expenditures (OPEX), and investments. This system provided comprehensive reporting, tailored to meet the client's specific needs, ultimately enhancing efficiency and decision-making.
